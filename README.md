# Baseball_Analysis
My goal is to see if there are situations where pitchers throw very hittable balls based on throw position and other elements you can see before the pitch is made. There also might be mistakes that can be told from where the pitcher releases the ball, which might result in more balls. 

First I want to develop a model to see what balls are hittable and for which batters.
Then I want to see if any pitchers are prone to throwing hittable balls based on hand positioning. 
I want to see if there are any outcomes we can predict with better accuracy than assuming the same ball-strike ratio, and maximize that.
